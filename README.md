ESP Now Slave Test - I tested ESPNow WiFi comms under water in a bucket and found that I could get 15cm range between two M5 Stick C Plus modules.
 
This means I can have two GoPro enclosures communicating bi-directionally across the 7cm water gap between the two sides of the cable spool held by the diver. The second enclosure will contain an audio system for audible and haptic/vibration guidance.
